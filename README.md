# Every systemd.

A bot that posts random dictionary words with a d appended to the end and systemd before them to mastodon.

## Deployment

Honestly, why would you want to deploy this? Whatever.. Here's how you'd do that..

1. Fetch the code
2. Copy `settings.example.json` to `settings.json`
3. Fill in your values
4. run `python3 every_systemd.py`
5. (optional) create a cronjob to run it automatically
6. (optional) create a pull request adding more words to the dictionary (please)
